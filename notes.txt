OS Program 3 Notes:
Linked lists denoting powers of two, between ASIZE and MSIZE, inclusive
MSIZE will never be higher tha 2^32
One list per possible block
each list entry denotes an unused block of memory

EX:
smallest allocation is 128 bytes, total 1024 bytes of memory
4 lists:
	128
	256
	512
	1024
At beginning, all lists are empty, save for list of 1024, 
which has a single block starting at address 0

When a request for allocation occurs, round up to next power of 2
	ex 200->256
find first free block that can hold 256, only 1024 is available.
	This is far larger than needed, so split into two 512 blocks(one at 0, another at 512)
	place entry for location 512 into list of 512s, split address 0 again(one at 0, another at 256)
	block at 256 is now places into list of 256s, address 0 size 256 is used to fulfill request
	NOTE: We always assign the one with the smaller address

If request cannot be fulfilled(no blocks big enough avaialble) then it's placed on the deferred request list
	this is a linked list of requests

For deallocation
	Find buddy: If edu.prog3.Model.Block B has address A and size K, compute A/K
		if A/K is even, then buddy addr is A+K; otherwise A-K
		examine list of Ks to find block with buddy address
			if NOT found, then entry for B is addedd to list of Ks
			otherwise, remove buddy from list, and join with B to create larger B' with size 2K and address min(B, BBuddy)
				continue as if you were trying to remove B'. guaranteed to terminate
	Once deallocation is done, check if any deferred requests can be completed, FIFO.
	
	
STRUCTURE OF DATA:

n number of linked lists
where n = log2(MSIZE) - log2(ASIZE) + 1

Arraylist(or just array?) of Linked Lists
Linked lists are lists of blocks, index in Arraylist tells you the block size(idx0 = 2^0=1, idx2 = 2^2=4, etc)
		MAYBE NOT: You cannot go below ASIZE or above MSIZE, plus n isn't consistent with the above
		Each list is BlockList, which has the size of blocks in it?
		Index could still work, just need to limit min and max index

linked list for deferred allocation requests
list of existing allocations(a queue, probably?)

Allocation: id, address, size

Block: address, size
	static findBuddy()

Request: ABSTRACT, id
		DeallocationRequest
		AllocationRequest: size
